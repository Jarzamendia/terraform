# AKS

## Vantagens

Manages Kubernetes API servers and the etcd database.
Runs the Kubernetes control-plane single or in multiple availability zones.
Scales the control-plane as you add more nodes to your cluster.
Provides a mechanism to upgrade your control plane and nodes to a newer - version.
Rotates certificates and keys.

On Azure running the AKS incurs no cost for the control plane â€” you only pay for what you use by the worker nodes.

However, if you want a guaranteed Service Level Agreements of 99.95% uptime or higher, the additional cost is USD0.10 per hour per cluster.
